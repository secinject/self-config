# self-config

This repository serves as a sort of quick download of config files for certain programs I use regularly.
Like Terminator, and my global keyboard shortcuts, and some browser ones.
Because I have customized a lot of them, whenever i re-flash a new OS, I have to set all these
 And I feel as though the better I get at Linuxand web app hacking, I think this section will grow bt by bit.
Anyway have a good one.
